###Tested with clean flash of Jetpack 2.2.1 on TX1
###Tested with Intel SSD 730
###Tested on 8/4/2016
###Tested with Tegra210_Linux_R24.1.0_armhf.tbz2
###Tested with Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R24.1.0_armhf.tbz2

##Tested on 1/14/2017 
##Tested with Samsung Evo 750 120GB SSD
##Tested with Tegra210_Linux_R24.2.1_aarch64.tbz2
##Tested with Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R24.2.1_aarch64.tbz2

###This process was done on a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 with an ultrabay expansion to 
###swap in and out a SSD as seen here http://a.co/ctPOGup

###Done on HOST PC(laptop) go to
https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra
###download latest version .
download Jetson TX1 64-bit Driver Package
download 64-bit Sample Root Filesystem
move both to home directory.

###Extracts files and moves the sample filesystem to rootfs keeps permissions.  Do not use GUI extract

sudo tar -vxjf TegraXXX_Linux_RXX.X.X_armhf.tbz2
cd Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs
sudo tar jxpf ../../Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_RXX.X.X_armhf.tbz2

###Run the apply_binaries.sh script to copy the NVIDIA libraries into rootfs directory.

cd ..
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh

###Format target storage to ext4 and mount it.
###use lsblk to make sure you are formatting the correct drive in my case only two storage devices are present on host

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
sudo mkdir /mnt/jetson
sudo mount /dev/sd? /mnt/jetson

###Copy Sample file system to target storage and unmount it.

cd Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs
sudo cp -a * /mnt/jetson && sync
sudo umount /mnt/jetson

###Turn on JetsonTX1 with previous clean installation of jetpack.

cd /boot/extlinux
ls
sudo gedit extlinux.conf

###locate argument "root=/dev/mmcblk0p1" or something similar to this near the end
###change to "root=/dev/sda"  
###sda assumes that there are no other partitions on the SSD
###save file
###Turn off TX1

sudo shutdown -h now

###Make sure that there are no other storage devices except the SSD connected
###Turn on TX1 it should boot the SSD as root filesystem and show the internal eMMC as a SDCard on the unity launcher
